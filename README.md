PathoScope 2.0
==========

### ISSUES:
- (@saik): This package is totally borked and does not work with Python3... A migration is needed for secure use, as Python2 is no longer considered secure.

#### Quick Start

If you would like to get started using PathoScope, chek out the following tutorial:

#### Introduction
Pathoscope 2.0 consists of four core and two optional analysis modules for sequencing-based metagenomic profiling. The PathoLib module extracts genome reference libraries (target or host/filter) from all available sequences in the NCBI Nucleotide database that belong to a user-defined taxonomic clade. The PathoMap module aligns the reads to the target reference library and removes any reads that have sequence similarity with the host or filter genomes. PathoID resolves read ambiguity, identifies which of the target genomes are present in the sample and estimates the proportions of reads originating from each genome. PathoReport provides two report files: 1) a summary report (.tsv) that contains the numbers and proportions of reads aligned to each genome identified in the sample, and 2) detailed report (.xml) including read coverage, read assignments, and contiguous sequences generated by combining the reads. The PathoDB is an optional module that provides additional annotation (organism taxonomic lineage, gene loci, protein products) for all sequences identified in the sample. The PathoQC module can be used to preprocess the reads prior to alignment with PathoMap.
